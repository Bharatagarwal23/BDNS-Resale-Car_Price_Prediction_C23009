Our aim in this Linear Regression project was to use Spark and MongoDB to create a model for predicting the selling price of new cars. 
Despite achieving an initial R2 score of 0.45, indicating room for improvement, we proposed several steps to enhance the model. 
These steps include conducting residual analysis, evaluating feature importance, and assessing assumptions. Exploring alternative regression algorithms, 
employing feature engineering and regularization techniques, and utilizing cross-validation were suggested. Despite limitations, this project has the potential to assist 
car sellers, buyers, and dealerships in making informed decisions regarding car selling prices
